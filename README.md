## Memory Modules Overview

### Single-Port RAM

A Single-Port RAM allows either a read or a write operation at a time through a single address port. It's commonly used in applications where simultaneous read and write operations are not required.

**Features:**
- Supports read and write operations.
- Single address port for accessing memory locations.
- Suitable for sequential data access scenarios.

### Dual-Port RAM

A Dual-Port RAM enables simultaneous read and write operations through two separate address ports. This feature is beneficial in systems requiring concurrent data access, such as in multi-processor configurations.

**Features:**
- Allows concurrent read and write operations.
- Two independent address ports for flexible data access.
- Enhances performance in parallel processing environments.

### ROM (Read-Only Memory)

ROM is a non-volatile memory used to store fixed data that does not change over time. It's typically utilized for storing firmware or lookup tables in digital systems.

**Features:**
- Read-only access to stored data.
- Data remains intact even after power loss.
- Ideal for storing constant information like firmware.

## Simulation and Testing

Each memory module is accompanied by a dedicated testbench to verify its functionality:

- **Single-Port RAM Testbench:** Validates read and write operations, ensuring data integrity during sequential access.

- **Dual-Port RAM Testbench:** Tests simultaneous read and write operations on different ports, confirming independent data handling.

- **ROM Testbench:** Checks the accuracy of data retrieval from predefined memory locations.

To run the simulations:

1. Use a Verilog simulator like ModelSim or XSIM.
2. Compile the Verilog module and its corresponding testbench.
3. Execute the simulation to observe the waveform and verify functionality.

## Applications

Understanding and implementing these memory modules is crucial for designing efficient digital systems. Applications include:

- **Single-Port RAM:** Suitable for buffer storage, registers, and simple data caching mechanisms.

- **Dual-Port RAM:** Ideal for systems requiring parallel data processing, such as dual-core processors and real-time data acquisition systems.

- **ROM:** Used in storing firmware, microcode, and fixed lookup tables essential for system initialization and operation.
